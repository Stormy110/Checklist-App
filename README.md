## Double Bubble
#### Double Bubble is a to-do list app made with Express.js, Node.js, and Sequelize.js. Styled with CSS.

Double Bubble allows the user to sign up for an account, log in to their account and then add things to their to-do list. They have the option of clicking complete or incomplete and the to-do item will then go to the corresponding list. The user can then log out and their data is saved in the database. This allows multiple users to use the application while saving everybody's data.
